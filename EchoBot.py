# In creating Echo Chatbot, I implement
# some patterns that Iâ€™ll use as I develop more complex chatbot programs:
# 1. Greeting a user.
# 2. Informing the user that they are interacting with a bot (and not a human).
# 3. Instructing the user on how to interact with the bot.
# 4. Accepting user input.
# 5. Setting up output that is dependent on user input.
